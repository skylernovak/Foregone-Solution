# Foregone-Solution
Google Code Jam 2019 - Qualification Round 

This was my solution to the Foregone Solution challenge for the google code jam 2019 qualification round.

I executed the "brute force" approach. It passed the first test set, but could not solve the problem with the parameters in the second test set,
running out of time. The second test set had the possibility of contatining a variable up to 10^9.
